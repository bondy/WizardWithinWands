  <p>Egypt is  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_by_population" title="Countries by population">fifteenth most populous country</a> in the world. The vast majority of its 78.8 million population (2006)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt#_note-Factbook" title="">[1]</a> live near the banks of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_River" title="Nile River">Nile River</a> (about 40,000&nbsp;km&sup2; or 15,450&nbsp;sq miles) where the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable" title="Arable">arable</a> agricultural land is found.The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled  with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed  for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. <img src="../../demos/gallery/galleries/egypt/thumbnails/egypt_02.jpg" hspace="4" align="left" alt="Pyramids of Egypt">A  unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled  in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to  the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks,  Romans, and Byzantines. </p>
  <p>It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the  Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six  centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250  and <img src="../../demos/gallery/galleries/egypt/thumbnails/egypt_06.jpg" hspace="4" align="right"  alt="Pyramids of Egypt" />continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman  Turks in 1517. Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869,  Egypt became an important world transportation hub, but also fell  heavily into debt.</p>
